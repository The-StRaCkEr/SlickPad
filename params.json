  "body": "### SlickPad - The Origin.\r\nSlickPad Originated on October 19th 2016. With a vision in mind, the creator of SlickPad, Shashwat, imagined what difficulties people have with the old and boring style of notepad in windows. Keeping this in mind, Shashwat invited Yash Hirani as A co-developer for SlickPad, which he readily accepted. This wasn't it, SlickPad was discontinued in between by Shashwat, but decided to complete it anyway to give the users a better option than Notepad.\r\n\r\n\r\n### The Code\r\nSlickPad is extensively coded in Java 8, making use of Javafx 8, the latest package of Javafx. At some points, hints of batch scripting is used which makes this an only windows app. SlickPad makes use of several public libraries like JFoenix, \r\nControlsFx and RichTextFx. I would like to thank their creators for their support during this project. This Project is open to anyone, and everyone may contribute in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have any bug or issue to report of SlickPad, visit the GitHub page of TheTrio(@TheTrio). Also, you can email Shashwat at shashwatkhanna312@gmail.com\r\n",
