<h2>About SlickPad</h2>
<p>
SlickPad is a basic text editor which can be used for light programming. It supports Syntax highlighting and was a practice project which I made for Fun. SlickPad can do some basic functions like editing, saving and opening files. It has support for <b>Notifications</b>, which alert the user if the file hasn't been safed.

<h2>The Thought</h2>
<p>
The one and only reason behind SlickPad was to make myself more familiar with Java. Built within 3 days, SlickPad is just an unbaked project, which probably I'll discontinue, as I am planning on working on an even bigger Project - Javafx Game Development. But till then this program manages to replicate the Windows Notepad, but even surpasses it in some ways.

<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>
In SlickPad, I have made use of various libraries build by many helping people out there. 
It's not possible to thank everyone, so I will just name the library and the link to their 
Website.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://fxexperience.com/controlsfx/">ControlsFx - 8.4.0.12</a></li>

</ul>

<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>
After the Success of Horizon, this project was just a coffee one, made for fun. I never intended to complete it though I feel that its pretty good now. In its Version 2.5.0, SlickPad might just break away. But the Future seems to be Bright, for I am aiming for Javafx Game Development. Feel free to download and edit the code.
